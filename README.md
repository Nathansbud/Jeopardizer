# Jeopardizer: Jeopardy, for the folks at home!

## What?

Jeopardy is awesome, and Jeopardy fans are even cooler! J-Archive has an archive of (nearly) every Jeopardy game to date, and thanks to a shoddily made scraper, so do I!

Unfinished as of now, but this will be a way to host games of Jeopardy with actual questions and categories, with individual players buzzing in via Arduino buzzers to answer! Stay tuned!
